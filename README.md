# Our Project: Enhancement of PredNet + Optical Flow analysis for the movement prediction of the Rotating Snake Illusion

Please refer to the Readme files in both PredNet_scripts and optical_flow_scripts.

This project was done as part of the course Vision - Mechanisms, Models and Algorithms by Dr. Hedva Spitzer, Tel-Aviv University.

This is an enhancement to the original code, which includes a full reproduction of the results (includes bug fixes and a full transition to Python 3.8, with Windows 10).
The models and results prodoces in this work are available per demend, please reach out.

The original data can be found referenced in the original paper, and more specifically, training data can be found at https://figshare.com/articles/Training_data/5483668/1, and test data can be found at https://figshare.com/articles/Test_data/5483680/1.
